#### The C++ bindings to libpmemobj

The **C++ bindings** provide a less error prone version of libpmemobj
through the implementation of a pmem-resident property, persistent pointers,
scoped and closure transactions, locking primitives and many others.

The [C++ documentation](cpp_html/index.html) contains the description of all
available classes.

Please be aware that this is still an **experimental API**.
